	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is the time taken by an algorithm to complete the program as a function of imput size. For efficient program the time complexity should be lesser.</p>
	<p> Space Complexity is the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. For an input of array of size n, the space complexity is O(n). <b>Space Complexity</b></p>
